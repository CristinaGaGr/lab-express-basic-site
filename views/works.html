<p>Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As
    a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a "wunderkind", such as his plan to provide free electricity
    for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan stopped by government pen pushers claiming it's illegal to
    store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon, wearing vintage
    t-shirts sporting superhero logos, or spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the
    introduction of the fork into Thailand). While he might claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have
    his faults. Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene; an overly intellectual
    personality; a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor; and a general lack of humility or empathy, the
    former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his
    superior intellect. </p>
