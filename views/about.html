<p>Dr. Sheldon Lee[1] Cooper,[2] B.S., M.S., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D.,[3] is a Caltech theoretical physicist. Along with his
    best friend, Leonard Hofstadter, he is the main male protagonist of The Big Bang Theory and is the main protagonist
    of Young Sheldon. Sheldon was born alongside his twin sister Missy around February 1980 in a Kmart in Galveston,
    Texas to George Cooper Sr. and Mary Cooper, and was officiated at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. He has an older
    brother named George Jr., who, along with Missy, is described by their mother to be "dumb as soup." Sheldon was
    raised according to his mother's Evangelical Christian doctrines, (i.e; learning how to pray and becoming the
    co-captain of the East Texan Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League Championship team and seven-to-twelve
    year-old division). Meanwhile, he was forced to watch football by his father</p>

<p>Like any typical nerd, Sheldon was bullied a lot during his childhood, mostly because he constantly expressed
    intellectual superiority to his peers as he still does now. The bullying consisted of, but was not limited to, being
    beaten up, getting swirlies (even in church), noogies and wedgies, and having his personal belongings stolen. This
    is further accentuated when he tells Amy Farrah Fowler that the memories of his upbringing were tantamount to that
    of an insufferably tantalizing "hell". Further anecdotes also reveal that he built a so-called "Sonic Death Ray"
    that didn't even slow down the neighbor kids (all it did was annoy their dog), and constructed an armed robot using
    integrated circuits from ceramic semiconductor substrates cooked in Missy's modified Easy-Bake Oven, to defend his
    room from Missy (whose eyebrows were burned off as a result of a malfunction). Sheldon was also beaten up by his
    brother and sister, with Missy usually kicking Sheldon in his crotch.</p>
